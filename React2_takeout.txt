When using React, it is recomment to add only one function to a component to avoid confusion.
Name of the component need to be capitalize or ReactDOM will ignore it.
You can use style as an attribute inside return of a component.
Function inside a component can be reusable to reduce the size and process time for the program.
You can insert multiple small components into a big component.
You should seperate function that process code away from function that display the program.
